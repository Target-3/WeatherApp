  This is the simple website to know the weather at your location. I have used <a href="http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> API for data. When a user clicks on the temperature value, it toggles between Celsius to Fahrenheit. This website is hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>

The icons that I used for this project are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.
