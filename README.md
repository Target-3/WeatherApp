Weather app will show the local weather information that it will get from the API.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons that I used for this project are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
